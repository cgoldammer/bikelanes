# Overview

If you want to bike in NYC without imminient fear for your life, you'll use bike lanes. To understand bike lanes, you have to see them. Maybe you know about cases like [cars driving on protected bike lanes](https://www.bicycling.com/news/a45459055/watch-this-cyclist-take-on-cars-in-the-bike-lane-in-nycand-win/) or [Queensboro bridge](https://www.amny.com/news/queensboro-bridge-bike-lane-delay/) that manages to make the bike lane so narrow that you can't fit two bike markings next to each other.

If you're new to all this, here's some background:
1. [The official NYC bike lane map](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikemaps.shtml)
2. [Types of bike lanes](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/bike-lanes/)

These are egregious cases, but what is the average experience along bike lanes? To find out, let's look at some pictures: Are they protected? Are there dangers on the road? You can also find the pictures [on a map. **Warning: 20MB download**!](https://cgoldammer.github.io/bikelanes/map.html)

As of 2023, NYC has 994 miles of bike lanes, with strong difference by borough, e.g. protected paths are  most prominent in Manhattan:

| borough       |   None |   Sharrows |   Standard |   Protected Path |   Greenway |
|:--------------|-------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------------:|-----------:|
| Bronx         |     17 |         15 |         66 |               14 |         32 |
| Brooklyn      |     36 |         40 |        147 |               30 |         41 |
| Manhattan     |     28 |         22 |         58 |               67 |         51 |
| Queens        |     38 |         43 |        100 |               39 |         28 |
| Staten_Island |     22 |         12 |         16 |                2 |         19 |


Let's take these lanes and look at pictures of them along the way, I am aiming for one picture every 218 yards (aka 200m). Let's call this a "spot". So far, the data includes 727 coded spots, and one can think of this as covering around 9% of all spots in the city. Results are tentative, thus I have some  caveats:

1. I'm only covering a small share of bike lanes
2. Some images are outdated, and that can mean that I miss improvements that have happened since then
3. There's some judgment calls involved
4. I'm not a planning or transportation researcher, I have read very little relevant research, so please don't take my personal read of this data as policy guidance. If I do make mistakes or wrong suggestions, tell me so. I'll read and learn. 
5. Some images are mis-coded, and I'm working on validating everything.

What am I taking away?

1. Parking protected lanes are quite good!
2. Sharrows are sad!
3. Protected isn't protected

It's easy to complain, and I will do plenty of that. But I also want to highlight that bike lanes have dramatically improved. Very often, the images I work with are outdated, and the infrastructure has since been improved.

Coming up as I work on this:
1. How good is this lane: How likely am I to have no obstacles?
2. All pictures on a map
3. Why are there so many moving trucks in Brooklyn?
4. I think the official city map is mis-coded in bulk? I'm validating.

# Parking protected lanes are quite good!

I came in with a low expectation for lanes that use parking as the physical barrier, but I came out positively surprised. These bike lanes mostly look safe and free of obstruction. Not in the sense of the perfect world I'd love to live in, but in the practical sense that's achievable in a car-dominated city. But you don't need to trust me! See below and judge for yourself, based on a random sample!

# Sharrows are sad!

What's a sharrow? In practice it's a bike sign printed on the road, with the expectation that bicycles and cars will get along. I can't quantify the impact, but I can look at sharrows. And my first instinct is that I share the conclusion by the author above: To bicyclists, these feel like streets that are owned by cars.

# Many a "protected" lane isn't protected

Above, I mentioned that I've been positively surprised by parking protection. I don't like being a stickler, but in a deeper sense that's not really protected: Without a car, there's no physical barrier. But in practice, NYC is so full of parked cars that it's close enough.

What seems very much missing is a true physical barrier: For example, stone. This could mean a little stone barrier, or an elevated curb. And in the absence of this barrier, it's common to use plastic or lines (more on that below), and I don't feel so protected. Let's see a random sample, with one big warning: It's possible that the lanes might have been improved since then. I've cross-checked a couple of them against recent Google streeview pictures, but let me know if this sample is biased.
